<h2><strong>Bucatini all'Amatriciana</strong></h2>
<p>Pasta smothered in a spicy tomato sauce with rich cured pork and tangy Pecorino Romano.</p>
<p><h3><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h3></p>
<ul>
<li>1 tablespoon (15ml) extra-virgin olive oil</li>
<li>170g guanciale, cut into slices about 1/8 inch thick and then into 3/4- by 1/4-inch strips</li>
<li>60ml dry white wine</li>
<li>794g can whole peeled tomatoes, crushed by hand</li>
<li>450g bucatini pasta</li>
<li>30g grated Pecorino Romano cheese, plus more for serving</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Instructions:</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. </li> 
<li>Add guanciale and pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes.</li>    
<li>Add wine and cook, scraping up any browned bits on bottom of pan, until nearly evaporated, about 3 minutes.</li>
<li>Add tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, boil pasta in salted water until just shy of al dente, about 1 minute less than package recommends.</li>
<li>Cook over high heat, stirring and tossing rapidly, until pasta is al dente and sauce has thickened and begins to coat noodles.</li>
<li>Remove from heat, add cheese, and stir rapidly to incorporate.</li>
<li>Season to taste with more salt and pepper. Serve right away, passing more cheese at the table.</li>

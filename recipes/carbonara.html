<h2><strong>Authentic Carbonara Like A Roman</strong></h2>
<p>An authentic carbonara is made with egg yolks, pecorino romano, guanciale, black pepper and pasta.</p>
<p>This recipe is the traditional one you will find in any Roman restaurant.</p>
<p><h2><strong>Ingredients:</strong></str></h2></p>
<ul>
<li>pasta</li>
<li>eggs</li>
<li>pecorino romano</li>
<li>black pepper</li>
<li>guanciale</li>
</ul>
<p><h2><strong>Instructions:</strong></h2></p>
<ol>
<li>Bring a pot of water to boil. When it is boiling, add salt. Throw the pasta in and cook until it is just before al dente.</li>
<li>When the water is about to boil, add the guanciale to a cold pan.</li>
<li>Turn the heat up to medium and let the guanciale cook until it is crispy and the fat has rendered, about 10-15 minutes.</li>
<li>Remove the guanciale from the pan, and leave the fat in.</li>
<li>If pasta is not ready by this time, remove the pan from the heat until pasta is done cooking.</li>
<li>While guanciale is cooking, make the carbonara cream in a small bowl, beat together egg yolks, pecorino romano, 2 spoons of guanciale fat, a little bit of pasta water and ground black pepper.</li>
<li>Add the pasta to the pan, and add about half of a ladle of pasta water to the pan as well.</li>
<li>Be careful when adding the pasta to the pan because the guanciale fat will splatter</li>
<li>Let the pasta cook in the pan for a few minutes, until it is al dente.</li>
<li>Add more pasta water if needed. You want there to be a bit of starchy liquid left at the bottom of the pan, and not have it be completely dry.</li>
<li>Remove the pan from the heat. Add the carbonara egg cream and mix.</li>
<li>Add the guanciale and mix again.</li>
<li>Plate and top with additional ground black pepper and pecorino romano.</li>
</ol>
